# of2112-cht-possibleBug
of2112 results not coincident with of2106 analitical results. The case is the one reported below, where h is the convective coefficient of the far left od the domain. It is set so low as it should represent vaccuum.

If the case is run using of2106 the analitcal solution is catched if it is run using of2112 it is not catched.
